> Excellent work around maths and physics; very elegant layout, and the graphics - both UDG and standard blocks - represents perfectly the ZX BASIC flavour... Nice design as well for the bottom lines with scores and shooting parameters.
And the different animations of the flags during the game and for the winner are very nice too!
This could have been a perfect example of use of computers in the 80s for studying at school.
Very good work!
