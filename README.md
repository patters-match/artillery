This could have been a perfect example of use of computers in the 80s for studying at school.
Very good work!

This game is a BASIC demake of Artillery for Macintosh by Kirk Crawford:

Sinclair BASIC has no `ELSE` construct in its conditional logic. This often forces complex logic into a mess of `GO TO` or `GO SUB` instructions which 
severely impair performance. Refining the trajectory loop logic was very tricky, as can be seen [here](trajectory_loop.md).
